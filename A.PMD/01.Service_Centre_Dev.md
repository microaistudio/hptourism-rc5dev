# Service Centre Refinement & Enhancement

## Goal Description
Refine the `ServiceCenterPanel` component in the dashboard to improve user experience, fix navigation issues (remove full page reloads), and correctly display the "Under Development" guardrails.

## Proposed Changes

### Dashboard Component
#### [MODIFY] [service-center.tsx](file:///home/subhash.thakur.india/Projects/hptourism-rc5dev/client/src/components/dashboard/service-center.tsx)
- **Navigation**: Replace `window.location.href` with `useLocation` hook from `wouter` for client-side transitions.
- **GuardRail**: Integrate the unused `GuardRail` component to inform users about features in testing.
- **UI Improvements**: 
    - Ensure valid mobile responsiveness for the panel container.
    - Improve button grouping logic if needed (e.g. keep "Renew" prominent).
    - Group secondary actions ("Delete Rooms", "Change Category", "Cancel Certificate") into a "More" (...) dropdown menu.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  **Navigation Check**: Click "Renew Certificate", "Add Rooms", etc. and verify the URL changes without a full browser refresh (network tab shouldn't show full page load).
2.  **GuardRail Check**: Verify the "Service guardrails" notice appears above the list of applications when applicable.
3.  **Responsiveness**: Resize the window to mobile width and ensure the buttons and text wrap correctly without overflowing.
