Dear Sir/Madam,

The Department of Tourism and Civil Aviation is developing the **Himachal Pradesh Homestay & Bed and Breakfast Registration Portal** to facilitate online registration and certification of homestays across the state. To ensure secure citizen authentication and Aadhaar verification, we wish to integrate with the **HP SSO (Him Access Citizen)** platform.

We have completed the technical implementation based on the HPSSO 2.0 Integration Kit and are ready for testing in the pre-production environment. To proceed, we kindly request the following credentials:

| # | Requirement | Purpose |
|---|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Pre-Production URL** | Endpoint for I-frame integration and token validation during testing |
| 2 | **Service ID** | Unique identifier for HP Tourism Portal within the HPSSO system |
| 3 | **Secret Key** | Encryption key for secure data exchange (AES-256-CBC) |

**Integration Benefits:**
- Unified login for property owners and district staff
- Aadhaar-verified registrations (eliminates fraudulent applications)
- Pre-populated citizen data from HP SSO profile

**Our Staging Environment:**
- URL: `http://10.126.117.27/` (Internal staging server)
- Callback endpoint: `/api/auth/hpsso/callback`

We are prepared to complete integration testing immediately upon receipt of credentials. Please let us know if any additional approvals or documentation are required from our side.

Thank you for your support in enabling seamless e-Governance services.
